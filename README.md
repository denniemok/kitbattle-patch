### Introduction
This plugin is made to address 2 well-known KitBattle exploits: Iron Fist Exploit and Smuggling Exploit. While the fixes are pretty straightforward, the exploits themselves are rather intricate. A really big shoutout to the dedicated players at BattleAsya, who consistently go above and beyond in their quest to unearth peculiar and amusing bugs.

Note that this plugin is specifically made for use with a [KitBattle Advanced (Premium)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/kitbattle-advanced.2872/) instance. All exploits mentioned on this page can be replicated on a clean Spigot 1.8.8 server with KitBattle installed.

### 1. Iron Fist (Damage Bug)
Undoubtedly the most long-lasting KitBattle exploit, Iron Fist (a.k.a Damage Bug), has gained notoriety for allowing sword damage from a previously selected kit to persist even after a player logs out and back in.

### 2. Smuggling (Teleport Bug)
Smuggling (a.k.a. Teleport Bug) enables players to conveniently transport kit items between arenas upon teleportation, resulting in the possession of items or effects from multiple kits, thereby disrupting the game balance.

### 3. Lag Machine (Arrow Particles Bug)
Abusers persistently abuse particles by generating hundreds of laggy arrows (with KitBattle trails) at spawn to destroy your server TPS and crash players with suboptimal PCs. Very often, this is done skillfully as these arrows have to get stuck somewhere and not get cleaned up.

For more details, please proceed to the [Wiki](https://github.com/denniemok/kitbattle-patch/wiki).
